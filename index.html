            I’ve been reflecting on our recent conversation and want to
            apologize if my words seemed to downplay the possibility of
            something more between us. I understand now that it might have been
            confusing or disappointing, and I’m really sorry for any hurt I may
            have caused.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden-text">
            The truth is, I deeply value our connection and genuinely like you.
            At the same time, I think it’s important for both of us to focus on
            our personal dreams and goals right now. I believe that pursuing our
            passions and ambitions can help us grow individually, and that’s
            something I’d love for us both to achieve.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden-text">
            I hope we can continue to support each other in our personal
            journeys and keep open lines of communication. I truly care about
            where things go between us, but I also think it’s important to align
            on our individual paths first.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden-text">
            Thank you for understanding, and I hope we can talk soon about how
            we can support each other’s dreams while we navigate this.
          </p>
